# General Embodiment Layer (GEL)

The General Embodiment Layer is the core execution substrate of PRAXIS.

All execution — digital or physical — must pass through GEL.

GEL responsibilities:
- Authority evaluation at execution time
- Execution lifecycle management
- Interruptibility and safe halt
- Observability and auditability

No intelligence model may execute actions directly.
