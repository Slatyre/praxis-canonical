# PRAXIS Glossary (Canonical)

This document defines canonical terms used throughout PRAXIS.
These definitions are architectural primitives, not marketing language.

Changes to this file must be deliberate.

## PRAXIS
A system implementing a General Embodiment Layer (GEL) that separates
reasoning, authority, and execution to enable governed action across
digital and physical environments.

## General Embodiment Layer (GEL)
A persistent, governable execution substrate that mediates between
reasoning and action. All execution occurs through GEL.

## Reasoning Model
A language or cognitive model (e.g. LLM, SLM) that proposes intent and
actions but does not execute them.

## Work-form Agent
A PRAXIS construct that binds a reasoning model to a persona,
constraints, and context. Agents do not execute actions directly.

## Agent Daemon
A mediation component that brokers communication between Work-form agents and
PRAXIS, validates intent, and enforces authority boundaries.
The daemon does not execute actions.

## Workspace
An isolated execution context within PRAXIS containing exactly one
active PRAXIS Cell.

## PRAXIS Cell
An exportable execution structure defining how tasks are coordinated
under a single purpose within a workspace.

## Artifact
A tangible, versioned input or output produced by execution and tracked
by PRAXIS.
